		<h1>Plants</h1>
		<div class="description">This is a small client side program that recreates an early coding project of mine. This is an evolution simulation I have made a few times in a few different languages. This model features grid of plant cells. A plant cell has a few attributes and can reproduce, creating additional plant cells with a similar set of attributes. Plant cells can also be infected with a virus. Over time, the population of plant cells will evolve to be more resistent to disease and gravitate towards other attributes that are suited for the particular parameters of the simulation.</div>
