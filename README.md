# plant-cells

This is a small client side program that recreates an early coding project of mine. I'm fascinated with evolution simulations, and this is one I have made a few times in a few different languages. The particular concept here is a grid of plant cells. A plant cell has a few attributes and can reproduce, creating additional plant cells with a similar set of attributes. Occaisonally, a disease will spread through the system. Over time, the population of plant cells will evolve to be more resistent to disease and gravitate towards other attributes that are suited for the particular parameters of the simulation.
